- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John Yuill
- Iâ€™m a former data analytics manager with a passion for unleashing the power of data by breaking down barriers between data and decisions. 
- After pushing the limits of spreadsheets for years, I made a full pivot to R for data programming in the mid-2010's and started spear-headed the use of R across teams I lead, often by getting in the trenches and leading by example.
- Now working independently, I'm always experimenting, learning, adapting, finding better ways to solve progressively harder problems.
- These repos are a collection of projects for learning, demonstration, edification, and my own amusement.
