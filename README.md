- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John Yuill
- Iâ€™m a data analytics manager with a passion for building teams that work together to improve understanding of the business environment and spot opportunities - and threats - using the power of data.
- After pushing the limits of spreadsheets for years, I made a full pivot to R for data programming about 5 years ago and have spear-headed the use of R across teams I lead.
- Always learning, adapting, finding better ways to solve progressively harder problems.
